This is the Have a go hero on page 79.

Take a look at the following test code, and fill in the missing Mocker demonstrations so that the test passes: 



>>> from mocker import Mocker, ANY
>>> mocker = Mocker()
>>> func = mocker.mock()
>>> func()			# doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<mocker.Mock object at ...>
>>> mocker.result(' any,string '.strip().split(',')) # i have no idea what I'm doing
>>> mocker.replay()
>>> func()
['any', 'string']
>>> mocker.restore()
>>> mocker.verify()

I just realized I think I have not pushed all the stuff I have at work on this. 
Where is the rest of the chapter 3 and 4 stuff?
Oh the chapter 3 stuff is in pid, but not sure about the ch 4 stuff.

This just isn't written well.

I think this is what it wanted me to do.

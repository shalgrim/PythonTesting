This is the Have a go here on page 73.

Try telling Mocker to expect a function call which returns a string,
which is then trimmed of whitespace and split on commas, and do it 
all as a single complex expression.

>>> from mocker import Mocker, ANY
>>> mocker = Mocker()
>>> func = mocker.mock()
>>> func()			# doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<mocker.Mock object at ...>
>>> mocker.result(astring).strip().split(',') # i have no idea what I'm doing
>>> mocker.replay()
>>> func()
whatgoeshere
>>> mocker.restore()
>>> mocker.verify()

I just realized I think I have not pushed all the stuff I have at work on this.  Where is the rest of the chapter 3 and 4 stuff?
Oh the chapter 3 stuff is in pid, but not sure about the ch 4 stuff.
